                    <p>Between the years of 1995 -2000 companies like Amazon and eBay introduced the e-commerce aspect of the internet.
                        Both these companies generated large profits and took the gamble of going public within a few years of being a start-up.
                        In a matter of weeks, Amazon’s stock prices skyrocketed and eBay was slowly following the same route, this led the venture
                        capitalist and stock investors to suddenly invest in companies that are ending with a “.com”.</p>
                    <p>This drove many startups and individuals to create bogus dot com e-commerce companies to get their investments
                        from wall street and get big quickly. As there was no set marker to evaluate which companies would sink or float, Venture capital
                        and investment banks took the risk of investing millions in many companies (dot com) to avoid missing out on an opportunity.</p>

                    <p>The bubble that formed over the five years fed by cheap money, easy capital, and pure speculation started to crash in early 2000
                        because valuations were based on earnings and profits that would not occur for several years. If the business model actually worked,
                        then investors were all too willing to overlook traditional fundamentals.</p>
                    <p>But when the invested capital began to dry up, so did the
                        lifeblood of cash-strapped dot-com companies. By the end of 2001, a majority of publicly traded dot-com companies folded, and trillions
                        of dollars of investment capital evaporated. However, in the end, the companies that surged and survived are today’s giants such as –
                        Amazon, eBay, Microsoft, Cisco, etc.</p>

                    <p>During this frenzy, many important tools were introduced within a short span of 4 - 5 years to keep up with the demand, one of them
                        being Fiber Optics cable. Before the bubble burst telecommunication companies wanted to get on the bandwagon by implementing and
                        introducing fiber optic cable across the US, which would allow for the maturation of the internet.</p>
                    <p>Because of a resulting excess of fiber in the years after the dot-com bubble burst, there was a severe overcapacity in bandwidth for internet usage that allowed
                        the next wave of companies to deliver sophisticated new internet services. Empowering companies like Amazon, eBay, and Microsoft to grow significantly.</p>
